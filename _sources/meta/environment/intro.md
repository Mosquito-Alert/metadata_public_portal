# Environment

Environmental raw datasets of interest are relative to local weather stations, climate medium scale, land coverage and general social-economic population data.

```{note}
Here we use the definition of _Raw Data_ in a very generic way, since environmental datasets are usually processed and validated by agencies before they are consumed by third-parties.
