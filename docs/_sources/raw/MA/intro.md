# MosquitoAlert

Mosquito Alert is a non-profit cooperative citizen science project, coordinated by [different public research centers](http://www.mosquitoalert.com/en/about-us/institutional-organization/). The goal is to study, monitor, and fight the spread of invasive mosquitoes capable of transmitting global diseases such as dengue, Zika, or West Nile fever. The tiger mosquito and the yellow fever mosquito are some of the invasive species that Mosquito Alert watches out for.

Surveillance is carried out with the [Mosquito Alert app](http://www.mosquitoalert.com/en/project/envia-datos/), which allows anyone to notify, by means of a photo, the possible discovery of one of the mosquitoes studied, as well as that of their breeding places in public spaces. Along with the photo the location of the observation and other necessary information to help in the identification of the species are collected. A human team of expert entomologists is in charge of validating the photos received and notifying the participant of the result. Finally, the result is published on the [public map](http://webserver.mosquitoalert.com/static/tigapublic/spain.html#/en/), where you can consult and download the observations recorded since 2014, as well as explore the probability models developed from the citizen observations.
